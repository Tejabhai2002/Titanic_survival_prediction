# Titanic_survival_prediction
The AIML project focuses on predicting Titanic passenger survival using the Naive Bayes theorem, considering age, passenger class (pclass), fare, and gender as features. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm widely used in machine learning. 

The project involves the following steps: data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, training the Naive Bayes model, and evaluation. The model learns the relationship between age, pclass, fare, gender, and the survival outcome. It calculates the probability of survival based on these features. 

Once trained and evaluated, the model can be used to predict the survival of new passengers by providing their age, pclass, fare, and gender as input. The Naive Bayes theorem utilizes conditional probability to make predictions. 

This AIML project offers a predictive tool to estimate the likelihood of survival for Titanic passengers, considering crucial factors such as age, pclass, fare, and gender.
